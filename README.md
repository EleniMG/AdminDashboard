### What I have learned:
- Inserting and editing SVGs
- Creating nested grids
- Using custom fonts
- Using relative units of measurement
- Using parent and child combinators to target certain elements


### Improvements to be made:

- Striking through to-do list entries when checkbox is ticked
- Creating an input box in the to-do list section and adding the text once user presses 'enter'
- 'New', 'Upload', 'Share' and notification buttons in the header
- Adding 'favourite' and 'share' buttons to the project tiles
